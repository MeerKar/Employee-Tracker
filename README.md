# Employee Tracker

This project has three parts:

1. Introduction
2. Problem
3. Solution

## Introduction

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**.rassignment This project is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

# Problem

I had a hardtime connecting my server to the database,and wasnot creation a package.json. With a quite number of code changing and importing different depencies and with the help of my tutor i could debug the issue.

# Solution

By connecting my database to the server application i could run the inquirer prompts and was able to make changes to database locally and was able to meet all acceptance criteria given below.
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

## Mock-Up
